# Doc2Vec
This project is for personal learning purposes. The project aims at finding representative vectors for documents in 
english langugage.
As of now, work has been done to find word vectors based on google's word2vec paper and code.
Presently, I am working on expanding gensim' s doc2vec model for learning docent representations.
In future, it is planned to use lstm network based approaches for learning document vectors.
